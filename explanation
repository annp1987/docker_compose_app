"version" is just describing which type of Docker-Compose file format you are going to use, there are several versions
you can choose.In this, I am currently using Version 3.

"Services" are just a way of declaring or differentiating the various containers which are made inside the service with
a unique name.

"restart" allows us to define frequency when to restart the build process in order to incorporate the change in environment
file or docker file.

"build" command is used to declare our source directory where docker needs to take files and run the system

"ports" command is used for mapping the ports for host and container.

"volumes" are mainly used for storing data which is generated inside the docker container on to the host machine so that
we can access it even after the container gets destroyed.

"links" create the bridge between containers so they can communicate with each other.
